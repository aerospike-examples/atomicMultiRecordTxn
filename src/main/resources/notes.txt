Done
----

Refactor to use KeyAsString sub-class
ProhibitedDelimiter super class
We're picking up locks in the txn namespace
Looking for transactions should be a query, not a scan
Allow lock for same txnid
Have AerospikeClientExtended implement an interface
Be more specific about exceptions in put method
Check that errors are re-thrown where they need to be
Do something about keyformatexception
Perhaps put exceptions in interface class
Check use of policy
Make sure inserts can be rolled back

Notes
-----

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 3000 -j DROP
